# Hi!

Welcome to my Blogdown website repository. Thanks for visiting.
For a better experience I suggest you hop over to my actual rendered Netlify blogdown page [here](http://eherdtersmith.rbind.io/).   

My website is more professional than personal although I do use it to chronicle the struggles/solutions that I have had and have found using R and Python for data science applications.  

I try to post new content frequently but would rather wait until I have something I think is useful rather than churn new content. Plus, ya know, I have a day job & a dog that would prefer to play 24/7 than sit around and watch me on my computer.
